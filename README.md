# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this exercise was to make sense of all of the raw data in order to identify the number of employees that are eligible for retirement what departments will be most affected and potentially which leadership postitions will have to be filled in the coming years. Exploiting raw data helps the HR dept to plan ahead for the coming years in order to secure talent and stability. 

## Results

There are several data with information that is important to this analysis. Under the retirement_info file we can appreciate all of the employees that will be eligible to retire in the coming years. There are also data that separates the HR by dept and seniority. 
Out of the data we uncover several trends that need to be addressed in an urgent manner. Most of the retiring staff have senior staffing roles. Creating a mentorship program as with the mentorship_eligability file would help the organization train the coming generation of senior staff. This trend is worrying because we can examine that the organization depends on this roles a great deal and will have to prepare in order to sustain growth in the industry. Through the mentornship eligibility we can identify key talent at a senior level that could train and help the next generation of management.
